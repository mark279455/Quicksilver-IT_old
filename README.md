# Quicksilver IT Site

README.md file for my Code Institutute first project.

I decided to do a simple design for a company that I used to own.
Quicksilver IT Ltd provided IT support for small businesses in Hertfordshire.

The site is designed to show potential customers what services the company offers, and encourage them to contact the company.

## Technology Used

HTML
CSS
Google Fonts
Font Awesome icons (these require javascript)

## Design


The site consists of 3 responsive pages.
index.html
service.html
contactus.html

### Colours

The Company's logo was a green Q - this is the text colour for the site.
A complementary colour has been added with a keyboard as a background.
These are:
#165B11 as text colour.
#a5f4dc as background

### Typography

The fonts used are from Google Fonts.
They are:
Montserrat - sans-serif

The creator is ot a fan of serif fonts.
